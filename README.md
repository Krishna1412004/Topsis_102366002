# TOPSIS Methodology Implementation

This project implements the TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method to evaluate and rank alternatives based on multiple criteria. The program reads input data, processes it according to the TOPSIS algorithm, and outputs the ranked alternatives with their scores.

## Overview

This program uses the TOPSIS method for decision-making by considering a set of alternatives, each evaluated based on several criteria. The program:

- Normalizes the input data.
- Applies weights to each criterion.
- Calculates the Euclidean distance from the ideal and worst solutions.
- Computes the TOPSIS scores.
- Ranks the alternatives based on their scores.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the program:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy
